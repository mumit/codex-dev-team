# Claude Dev Team Parity Checklist

Last updated: 2026-05-01

This checklist tracks whether `codex-dev-team` is on par with the local
`claude-dev-team` framework.

## Summary

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Commands | On par | Claude slash commands have Codex npm/CLI equivalents. |
| Pipeline tracks | Restructured (see Stage Numbering Divergence) | full, quick, nano, config-only, dep-update, and hotfix are represented. |
| Gates | On par | JSON gates, schemas, track contracts, validation, and auto-fold helpers exist. |
| Roles | On par | PM, Principal, Backend, Frontend, Platform, QA, Reviewer, and Security prompts exist. |
| Deployment adapters | Better | Codex has explicit adapter docs for Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Terraform, and custom scripts. |
| Status/roadmap automation | Better | Codex has JSON status, next, and roadmap outputs. |
| Rules | On par | Claude rule set has Codex-native equivalents under `.codex/rules/`. |
| Skills | On par | Claude convention, review, security, implementation, and pre-PR skills are represented under `.codex/skills/`. |

## Codex Improvements Beyond Claude

- npm/CLI shims work in non-Claude environments.
- Bootstrap installs into Node and non-Node projects without forcing package metadata.
- Status, roadmap, and next commands support JSON output for automation.
- Deployment adapters are documented and configured locally.
- Track-aware `next`, `prompt`, and `autofold` helpers reduce manual orchestration.
- Gate schemas and contract tests guard framework drift.
- `scripts/budget.js` (`npm run budget`) — opt-in token and wall-clock tracking
  per pipeline run; escalates or warns when configured maxima are exceeded.
- `scripts/visualize.js` (`npm run visualize`) — Mermaid stateDiagram-v2
  generator colors each stage by gate status; output is `pipeline/diagram.md`.
- Async checkpoint auto-pass logic — `checkpoints.a/b/c` in `.codex/config.yml`
  accept `no_warnings` or `all_criteria_passed` conditions so unattended runs can
  advance without a human `proceed` when the precondition holds.

## Stage Numbering Divergence

Codex collapsed claude's two pre-review gates (Stage 4.5a and 4.5b) into a
single codex Stage 5 pre-review step. This shifts all later stage numbers by
one relative to claude's numbering.

| claude stage | codex stage |
|---|---|
| 1 Requirements | 1 Requirements |
| 2 Design | 2 Design |
| 3 Clarification | 3 Clarification |
| 4 Build | 4 Build |
| 4.5a Pre-review | 5 Pre-review (lint/types/SCA) |
| 4.5b Security review (conditional) | 5 Pre-review records `security_review_required` |
| 5 Peer review | 6 Peer review |
| 6 Tests | 7 QA |
| 7 PM sign-off | 8 Sign-off (folded with deploy) |
| 8 Deploy | 8 Deploy |
| 9 Retrospective | 9 Retrospective |

Collapsing 4.5a/b reduces gate count by 1 in the common case (when no security
review is triggered). Security is still fully gated: the pre-review step
records `security_review_required: true` when the `security:check` heuristic
matches, and the pipeline halts for a security review before advancing to peer
review. Projects that always require security review can set
`security.always_required: true` in `.codex/config.yml`; the collapsing only
eliminates one extra JSON gate file, not the security check itself.

## v1.0 Blockers

- None. `npm run parity:check` fails if any command row, required rule,
  required skill, partial area, or known gap is present.

## Parity Status

`v1.0.0` was the initial parity release. `v1.1.0` deepened structural coverage.
`v1.2.0` (unreleased) adds shared runtime features (budget, visualize,
checkpoint auto-pass) that go beyond what `claude-dev-team` offers.
